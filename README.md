## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This challenge gave me a chance to continue working with media queries, hover states, and flexbox. I am feeling more comfortable with setting up my first layout but have difficulty when developing the media query.  

### Continued development

I plan to use grid over the next few challenges to gain more familiarity with how to use it effectively.
